On Waveshare product page, there is a WIKI link: https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/4.2inch-e-paper-module.htm?___SID=U.
Navigating to this page, there is a link to user guides when working with an ESP32. Clicking this link brings you to a page where
there is a link to demo code or the Github project. Either location has drivers for working with the device, as well as fonts that
can be used.
